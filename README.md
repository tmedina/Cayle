# Cayle

Cayle is a PHP web application for managing business operations for Nuçi's Space, a non-profit organization.

The application uses a calendar view to create, read, update and delete practice room reservations for musicians. It also allows users manage equipment rentals, food and refreshments, add these to a customer's final bill and check out.

This application was developed as a class project by The University of Georgia's Master of Information Science Program.

Nuçi's Space is a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting mental health awareness and suicide prevention among the music community of Athens, GA.

The software is named for Cayle Bywater, a Nuçi's Space volunteer and member of the UGA MIS class who initiated the project. Cayle was lost to suicide before the project was completed.
